This repository supports the study **"TWIST2 high expression defines a novel subtype of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia"**, which identifies and characterizes a rare but distinct molecular subtype of BCP-ALL driven by aberrant overexpression of the transcription factor *TWIST2*.

## Overview

By integrating transcriptomic data from **3,371 BCP-ALL samples** across 23 public and in-house datasets, we uncovered a previously unclassified subgroup (0.5%, n=17) with uniformly high *TWIST2* expression. This *TWIST2*-high subtype: - Lacks known canonical fusions (e.g., *DUX4*, *MEF2D*, *KMT2A*) - Shows mutually exclusive mutations in metabolic genes: **7 cases harbor a recurrent germline-associated *FH* A273T variant**, while **4 carry *IDH1/2* mutations** - Exhibits poor overall survival (\<50% at 3 years) - Displays gene expression signatures linked to **epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)**, **FGF signaling**, and **immunosuppression (e.g., CD274/PD-L1 upregulation)**

Functional assays confirm that *TWIST2* overexpression impairs proliferation in BCP-ALL cell lines and murine pro-B cells by inducing cell cycle arrest—consistent with its context-dependent tumor-suppressive role.
